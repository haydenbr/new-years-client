1. DON'T `npm install`.

2. Do you have Docker? If not, go a head and install it. Go [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for details.

3. Get the dev server running with `yarn start` (or `npm start` if that's your thing).

## Version 3 Update

As of version 3, the images used for development are tagged as `major.minor.patch-dev`. Production images for each version are tagged simply with the version number. Moving forward, images will be pushed to `haydenbr/new-years-client` instead of `unboxedtechnology/new-years-resolutions`.
